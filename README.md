## Abstract

We present a rigorous proof that the three-leaf clover knot with self-linking number L_k = 6 is the unique stable primordial configuration in the topological vacuum of the TET--CVTL framework. Numerical simulations and game-theoretic dynamics confirm convergence to the trefoil under Chern-Simons action and Ising braiding constraints.
